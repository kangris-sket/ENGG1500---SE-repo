##Work Flow and Policies
Once you have become familiar with the MIT App Inventor and picked your tools for collaboration and communication, it is a good idea to set the policies your group will operate with.

###What is a Policy?
A policy is simply a document which outlines a *course* or *principle* of action which has been adopted or proposed by an organization or individual.  For this project, you can think of them as defining a workflow (set of activities) to make the App development easier.

###Why is this important for your group now?
Have you noticed any limitations with the tools you are using?   Once clear limitation is that the MIT App Inventor tool is not collaborative in the same way google docs or another typically collaborative tool might be.

Your group will need to work out how you wish to use this tool, so that there is one master application being developed, without falling prey to syncing issues or missing features due to poor organisation.

###How will you choose to do this?
There is a number of ways you could choose to use this tool collaboratively.

* option:
	Assign a group member as the "developer" who will be responsible to update the application, and perhaps distribute the .apk or .aia files

	*  What is good about this option:
		 Keeps development centralised and there is less likely to be any chance of conflict

	*  What is not so good about this option:
		 Only one person is the "developer".
		 Is there a way around this?
		 Perhaps you can change who is in this role each week.  How would you switch developers week to week?  Will you simply pass the .aia file to the next person - or will you keep it somewhere centrally for the whole group (such as dropbox, or google drive)

* option:
	Create a google "admin" account that everyone can use to login and work on the app

	* What is good about this option:
		Only one account is necessary and there is no need for team members to load/redistribute projects

	* What is not so good about this option:
		Even though there might be one account, you cannot have 2 group members making changes to the same project in the MIT App Inventor build environment at the same time.  If you do so, there can be syncing issues, and it is possible that your development project will become irreparably damaged.
		So what can you do instead?
		Perhaps you can setup some kind of communication protocol, such as "add a post to the Facebook page - when you wish to work on the application".  That way, everyone should be able to know who is working on the application and when.

* option:
	Distribute the .aia files in a central repository so that group members can load a project to edit, then redistribute the .aia file once they have made changes

	* What is good about this option:
		Anyone in the group can load and distribute a project.

	* What is not so good about this option:
		How will you handle merge conflicts?
		Suppose two group members both load project_a.aia and make changes.
		The first member uploads project_b.aia while the second uploads project_c.aia.
		How will your group choose to make a project_d.aia which incorporates the changes from project_b.aia and project_c.aia?
		And what happens if there are features in each project with are in direct conflict with each other?
		How can you manage this?
		If your group decide to distribute the .aia files you will need to decide on a policy for this kind of situation

* option:
	Are there any other options you can think of?

	Remember, whatever system you choose to implement will likely be unique to your group.  The key thing will be deciding and clearly communicating how you and your group expect to manage the workflow, so that you experience the least number of issues when using the tool collaboratively.


##Give it to me Straight?


3. In your documentation area, work together to develop a policy regarding how your group will manage the collaboration of the application development

   Please note:  The above items are not assessable for this course.  However, groups who complete these tasks will have a much better chance of achieving higher marks on their assessable items.
