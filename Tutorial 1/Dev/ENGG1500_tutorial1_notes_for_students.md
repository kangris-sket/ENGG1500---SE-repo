#Tutorial 1

##About this project
In this course, you will work in a group to create an android phone app using the [MIT App Inventor platform](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/about-us.html).  The development of this App will simulate the kind of work flow you can expect in a real world development environment.  You will need to propose a design, gain approval for the project based on the design, implement your project, and report on the performance of your application.

##Know your tools
Before anything else, it is important to become well acquainted with the tool you are using. This week, you should focus on completing some of the Tutorials provided by the tool.  A cheatSheet for the MIT App Inventor platform has been provided with this week's materials.  You will want to keep this handy throughout the duration of this course.

###Training
####Complete the HelloPurr Tutorial
Everyone should complete the [first tutorial](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/hellopurr.html) to setup the Hellopurr App.
**Note:  Do not feel compelled to use the kitty image and meow soundFile provided with the tutorial.  Feel free to find your own or check blackboard for an alternate image/soundFile.**

####Complete some other tutorials
Many more tutorials can be found [here](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/tutorials.html).  The tutorials can be filtered based on the feature you wish to learn.
You many wish to try different tutorials to learn how to use different sensors (such as the LocationSensor, GyroscopeSensor, etc) or any other features you wish to learn.
Remember, **many hands make light work:** perhaps this is a good point to discuss the different android features with your group members, and decide who in your group might learn to be the group expert on a certain feature?

##What about other tools???
To work efficiently as a group, you will need to decide on a few other tools which will assist you.  The main tools you should consider are:

1. Collaborative Documentation:
   How will your group manage the documentation for this project?  Will you use a tool such as google drive with google docs?   What about dropbox for file sharing?  How about sharing a one note workbook?  It will be up to you and your group members to discuss and decide on this component.
2. Communication:
	 How will you and your group communicate with each other? Will you make use of your student email?  What about other options?
	 * Facebook group chat?
	 * Facebook group page?
	 * Google Hangouts?
	 * Skype?
	 * Discord?
	 When choosing a tool, think about the pro's and cons of each, and the features you would like to use.  For example, will you want features such as screen sharing or is a simple chat client all you require?

##Give it to me straight?
This week, there are a few tasks you should start on:

1. Familiarize yourself with MIT App Inventor: complete the HelloPurr tutorial plus a couple of extra tutorials
2. You and your group should decided on:
 	 * collaborative documentation tool
 	 * communication streams/tools
