#MIT App Inventor CheatSheet
When developing an application with the [MIT App Inventor platform](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/about-us.html), a **google login** account is required.

##Develop
###Build Environment
You will build your application in a browser [here](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu)

###Test Environment
For those of you with an android device - use the [companion app](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-device-wifi.html)
For anyone else - use the [emulator](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-emulator.html)

##Deploy
###Build
The app can be built/compiled for distribution and sharing.
To build the application: From the build environment with the project loaded, select the menu option **build -> App**.
Note:  for sharing the file, it is easiest to use the second option **(save to my computer)** then download as an **.apk file** which can be installed on your phone.

###Source Code
The **.aia file** or source code for a project can be exported from the build environment and shared among others. **.aia files** can be loaded to someone else's environment, so that they have the option to load the project, and make changes as required.
To download the source code: From the build environment with the project loaded, select the menu option **projects -> Export selected project (.aia) to my computer**

####Sharing a built app or source code
More details about sharing the .aia and .apk files [here](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/share.html)
